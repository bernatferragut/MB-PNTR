## 1.1.7

- Fixing bug where updating a color with alpha `0` would keep it opaque (Jorge Moreno)

## 1.1.6

- Adding `Rune.Node` to inject SVG nodes into the stage. Can be used if Rune.js does not support a specific tag.

## 1.1.5

- `fill()` and `stroke()` now support `false` (which renders no attribute) and `'none'` (which renders fill="none").
- Smaller filesize by procedurally adding getters and setters.

## 1.1.4

- `fill()` and `stroke()` will now disable fill if the string 'none' is passed to them.
- `fill()` and `stroke()` will no longer insert `file="none"` if set to false.
- Replaced `lodash.each` with for loops for speed and size improvements.
- Replaced `lodash.map` with native `map()` for speed and size improvements.
- Replaced `lodash.flatten` with custom `flatten()` for speed and size improvements.
- Replaced `lodash.defaults` with `lodash.assign` for size improvements.
- Replaced `lodash.assign` with `object-assign` for size improvements.
- Replaced `lodash.without` with custom `without` for size improvements.
- Unminified size went from 215kb to 160kb

## 1.1.3

- `Rune.Group` can now accept `fill()`, `stroke()`, and all other styling functions. This makes it easy to have a default style for all shapes in a group.
- Massive rewrite of tests that tried to be too smart.

## 1.1.2

- `Rune.Color` objects now accepts `rgb()` and `rgba()` strings.

## 1.1.1

- Calling `remove` on a group with a shape that is not in the group will not remove another shape in the group.
- Adding `viewBox` attribute on resulting SVG.

## 1.1.0

- Fixed a giant bug with re-rendering of children if they were removed/added to a group.

## 1.0.3

- The npm package now has a `/dist/rune.js` folder packaged for the browser.

## 1.0.2

- Actually fixing problem with re-rendering after removing child from group

## 1.0.1

- Fixing problem with re-rendering after removing child from group

## 1.0.0

- Renamed `Grid.modules` to `Grid.children` and combined functionality with `Rune.Group`

## 0.4.5

- Added `Rune.map()` function. Thanks to [Yining Shi](http://1023.io/)!

## 0.4.4

- Fixing rendering problem when using `shape.removeParent()`
- Fixing toPolygon for ellipse and circle. Now not doubling in size because of radius/diameter shuffling

## 0.4.3

- Removing ability to use percentage string in constructor. Should be done in CSS.

## 0.4.2

- Better handling for node and browser if instantiating an object with percentage strings or no values for width and height.

## 0.4.1

- Added `setStart(x, y)` and `setEnd(x, y)` to `Line`.
- You can now use percentage strings when instantiating a Rune.js object in a browser. `r.width` and `r.height` will be dynamically set to dimensions of the SVG based on browser rendering.

## 0.4.0

This release **changes the existing API**. It fixes a number of problems discovered while using Rune.js. Most important, it implements a new React-inspired rendering mechanism that only re-renders changed objects. The library used to loop through every object to generate a virtual DOM patch. This would make the actual DOM change fast, but it still took up a lot of memory to iterate through every object. This new release changes the rendering so only shapes that changes are re-rendered in memory, making the library efficient both in the memory cycles and in the the DOM manipulation phase.

- `.vars` is now called `.state`
- `draw` event is now called `update`. This should make it clearer to not to Processing-style overpainting.
- Implemented a new rendering strategy. This makes it a no no to change`.state` directly without calling the `.changed()` method on a shape. `.changed()` is automatically called for all shape functions that change the shape. Render time for 10k shapes fell from 12 seconds to 400 milliseconds.
- `Line` method `move()` now moves the entire line and not just the starting position.
- Shape functions no longer accept vectors. Will re-implement soon.

## 0.3.0

## 0.2.14

- `strokeWidth` is now scaled when calling `.scale()` on a shape
- Adding `round()` function to rectangles

## 0.2.13

- Removing `Groupable` mixin in favor of `Shape`
- Replacing underscore with lodash to shrink size of library

- Changing internal represenation of module from array of arrays to a single array of modules.

## 0.2.6

- Triangle `move()` now moves the entire triangle, not just the starting point.

## 0.2.5

- Fixing bugs around variables shadowing function names, which makes `Rune.js` work in Safari and most mobile browsers.

## 0.2.4

- Fixing a bug around `requestAnimationframe` not getting cancelled if used within the `draw` listener. [issue](https://github.com/runemadsen/rune.js/issues/4)

## 0.2.3

- NPM package now ships `rune.browser.js` for easy of install.

## 0.2.2

- Quick fix to not break node when checking for window.

- `Rune.js` is now tested and working in server-side node. Hurrah!

## 0.1.5

- Removing `rgba()` fill and stroke values and introducing straight up `rgb()` with `fill-opacity` and `stroke-opacity`, as Illustrator does not recognize `rgba()`.

## 0.1.3

- Adding `Triangle` and `r.triangle()`
- Fixing some math in the `Polygon` `bounds()` function
- Bounds and `bounds()` and `centroid` now return a `Vector` that hasn't the shape positions added. They now return internal representations.

- Initial release!
